      </p>
      <p>&ldquo;The opening of the Bloomingdale health center creates access to health care for patients in a town where there has been no medical provider.  The Town of Bloomingdale and Vermillion-Parke Community Health Center partnered together, creating the opportunity for access to health care, quality employment and dedication to this beautiful community,&rdquo; stated Elizabeth Burrows, health center CEO.<br />
