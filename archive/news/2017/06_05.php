  <h2>Health Center Earns National Recognition</h2>
  <h2 id="page-tinytitle">June 5, 2017</h2>
  <div id="archive-news-section">
    <p>Valley Professionals Community Health Center (VPCHC) recently received recognition through the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) as a Level 3 Patient-Centered Medical Home for its Crawfordsville facility in May.  NCQA Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Recognition is the most widely-adopted model for transforming primary care practices into medical homes for patients.</p>
    <p>The NCQA’s Patient-Centered Medical Home is an innovative program for improving primary care and is structured as a health care setting that facilitates partnerships between individual patients and their personal physicians, and when appropriate, the patient’s family. The Valley Professionals Clinton facility received Level 3 recognition in October 2013.</p>
    <p>In order to receive this recognition, Valley Professionals met rigorous standards set forth by NCQA concerning patient access to care, care coordination, continuity of care and accountability, as well as quality and safety. This 12-15 month-long project included the review of all clinic policies and procedures, as well as the creation and review of many reports on performance outcomes. Some changes that our patient’s may notice include increased access through same day appointment availability, patient education on disease management, and assistance with self-management of chronic conditions.</p>
    <p>&rdquo;I’m very proud to belong to an organization that is accredited by NCQA as a Patient-Centered Medical Home at all of our Valley Professionals sites. Our staff has proven to have the passion and dedication to accomplish high levels of quality for our patients,&rdquo; stated Valley Professionals CEO, T.J. Warren.</p>
    <p>Valley Professionals is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) that provides comprehensive and integrated health care for all individuals and families, while promoting health education opportunities for the community, students, and health care professionals. Valley Professionals provides primary care, behavioral health, dental and resource services to the citizens of Montgomery, Parke, Vermillion and Vigo counties, and surrounding communities.</p>
