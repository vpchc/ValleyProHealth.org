  <h2>Local Partnership to Increase Health Care Services</h2>
  <h2 id="page-tinytitle">March 27, 2017</h2>
  <div id="archive-news-section">
    <p>Valley Professionals Community Health Center is expanding its clinic locations by partnering with Waltz Family Practice in Rockville. Opening April 3rd, the health center will be located at 727 N Lincoln Road. This partnership will ensure continued high quality medical care for individuals and families.</p>
    <p>Available services include primary care and the treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, health maintenance, wellness exams, disease prevention, and more. Additional services provided at other Valley Professionals locations includes behavioral health care, dental care, and patient resource services. The health center accepts commercial and Marketplace insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, and offers a sliding fee scale, based on family size and income for individuals and families without insurance.</p>
    <p>&rdquo;This is truly an exciting time for Valley Professionals as we open our sixth location in the Wabash Valley. Over the past several years, we have strived to improve access to care for the communities we serve by creating convenient locations,&rdquo; stated health center CEO, T.J. Warren. &rdquo;The Rockville clinic further supports our mission of creating access by opening a second location in Parke County. In the future, our hope is to look at expanding this clinic to accommodate additional providers, such as, physicians, family nurse practitioners, and a psychologist.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Medical providers at the Rockville location include Dr. Steven G. Waltz, MD and Family Nurse Practitioner, Jordan Ryley. Dr. Waltz joined Valley Professionals in 2016 as Chief Medical Officer and is a long-time practicing physician of the Wabash Valley, well known by his patients and community. Dr. Waltz was awarded Teacher of the Year by Union Hospital’s Family Residency Program in the fall of 2016, and was also awarded the Physician Community Service Award in 2009 from the Indiana State Medical Association. His expertise and teaching continues to enhance the health center’s medical team in meeting the primary care needs of the health center’s service area and surrounding communities.</p>
    <p>Family Nurse Practitioner, Jordan Ryley, is also a long-time Wabash Valley resident. Ryley is a recent graduate of Indiana State University and holds a Master of Science in Nursing degree from the Family Nurse Practitioner program. Her favorite part of working for Valley Professionals is the connection she shares with patients and being part of the solution for the shortage of rural health providers. Ryley is excited to be a part of the Valley Professionals team and looks forward serving the community and providing care to new and current patients.</p>
    <p>Hours for the Rockville health center are Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, from 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and Tuesday and Thursday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. For more information or to schedule an appointment, please call (765) 569-1123.</p>
    <p>Valley Professionals Community Health Center is a federally qualified health center (FQHC) that provides comprehensive and integrated health care for all individuals and families, while promoting health education opportunities for the community, students, and health care professionals.  Valley Professionals currently serves the Wabash Valley and surrounding areas with locations in Clinton, Cayuga, Bloomingdale, Crawfordsville, Terre Haute, and Mobile School-Based Health Center that serves Parke and Vermillion county schools.</p>
