  <h2>Health Center Earns National Recognition</h2>
  <h3 id="page-tinytitle">January 12, 2015</h3>
  <div id="archive-news-section">
    <p>Valley Professionals Community Health Center (VPCHC) received recognition through the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) as a Level 3 Patient Centered Medical Home for its Cayuga and Bloomingdale facilities in December 2014.&nbsp; NCQA Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Recognition is the most widely-adopted model for transforming primary care practices into medical homes for patients.</p>
    <p>The NCQA&rsquo;s&nbsp; Patient Centered Medical Home is an innovative program for improving primary care and is structured as a health care setting that facilitates partnerships between individual patients and their personal physicians, and when appropriate, the patient&rsquo;s family. The Valley Professionals Clinton facility received Level 3 recognition in October 2013. </p>
    <p>In order to receive this recognition, Valley Professionals met rigorous standards set forth by NCQA concerning patient access to care, care coordination, continuity of care and accountability, as well as quality and safety. This 12-18 month long project included the review of all clinic policies and procedures, as well as the creation and review of many reports on performance outcomes. Some changes that our patient&rsquo;s may notice include increased access through same day appointment availability and the after-hours clinic, patient education on disease management and assistance with self-management of chronic conditions.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&quot;I&rsquo;m very proud to belong to an organization that is accredited by NCQA as a Level 3 Patient Centered Medical Home at all three of our sites. Our staff has proven to have the passion and dedication to accomplish high levels of quality for our patients,&rdquo; stated Valley Professionals CEO, T.J. Warren.</p>
    <p>VPCHC is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) dedicated to providing comprehensive primary health care and related services for all individuals, while promoting educational opportunities. VPCHC provides primary, behavioral health and dental care services to the citizens of Vermillion and Parke counties, and surrounding communities.</p>
