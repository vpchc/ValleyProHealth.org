  <h2>Health Center Names CEO</h2>
  <h3 id="page-tinytitle">November 3, 2014</h3>
  <div id="archive-news-section">
    <p>Valley Professionals Community Health Center (VPCHC) Board of Directors is pleased to announce that Terry J. Warren has been named Chief Executive Officer of Valley Professionals. This role will become effective January 1, 2015, once official approval has been given by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
    <p>Warren joined the health center in 2008, and has since held the position of Chief Financial Officer. During that time, Warren has achieved many accomplishments, including design and implementation of three facility expansion projects, implementation of employee benefits and pension plan, execution of a group purchasing plan that reduced cost per patient visit, as well as establishment of an entire accounting system, including chart of accounts, accounting software and financial policies for the organization, while being responsible for overseeing finance, quality, and outreach operations for Valley Professionals</p>
    <p>Warren is a senior executive at Valley Professionals, with more than nine years of experience in the health care industry. In addition to serving as CFO for the health center, Warren has additional experience as a chief accountant at a non-profit healthcare facility, as a tax and staff accountant at local CPA agencies, as well as a financial controller for a fuel and petroleum company.  Warren has received a Master of Business Administration degree in health care administration from Indiana Wesleyan University in Marion, IN, and Bachelor of Science in accounting at Indiana State University in Terre Haute, IN. He is married with three children.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very excited and honored that the board selected me over many other qualified candidates around the country,&rdquo; stated Warren. &ldquo;As CEO, my first priority is to get back to the roots of a community health center. My goal is to instill solid corporate values into our employees, making our health center one of the top choices in our community.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>Established in 2008, Valley Professionals (formerly Valley Professionals Community Health Center) continues to experience both significant and successful growth, through providing primary and behavioral healthcare services. Beginning with one health center location, Valley Professionals has expanded to three health center facilities in Clinton, Cayuga (2009) and Bloomingdale (2013) in Indiana, as well as a mobile school-based health center (2012). VPCHC offers an after-hours clinic at the Clinton facility, Monday through Thursday evenings, to provide available services so patients can avoid the emergency room for primary health care needs. All Valley Professionals locations accept Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance. If an individual does not have any health care coverage, they may be eligible for a sliding fee scale. The sliding fee scale is based on family size and income. Valley Professionals strives to provide the utmost quality care to help build healthier communities.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We are confident that T.J. will provide the leadership necessary to continue the successful growth that VPCHC has experienced since its inception,&rdquo; stated Jill Wesch, Valley Professionals board president. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>VPCHC is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) dedicated to providing comprehensive integrated health care for all individuals while promoting educational opportunities. VPCHC provides primary and preventive health care services, along with behavioral health services to the citizens of Vermillion and Parke counties, and surrounding communities.</p>
