  <h6>Summer Block Party</h6>
  <h6>July 21, 2015</h6>
  <div class="archive-section">
    <p>Valley Professionals Community Health Center (VPCHC) is celebrating one last opportunity of summer fun, before students head back to school, by hosting their 2015 Summer Block Party on Friday, July 31st at Sportland Park in Clinton, from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. The block party is being held in honor of the 50th anniversary of National Health Center Week (NHCW). The event is open to the public.</p>
    <p>The VPCHC Summer Block Party will feature lots of activities and fun for all, including local recording artist Abbi Scott, with special guest The Scott Webster Band. The event is a perfect opportunity for free family fun, with local community exhibitors, health education and screenings, fun zone, dunk tank, food, and more! Guests are encouraged to bring lawn chairs for the concert. There will be an opportunity for a meet and greet after the performance, in addition to available merchandise.</p>
    <p>By hosting this event, Valley Professionals would like to show thanks and appreciation for their patients, local community members, organizations, and businesses for their continued support, and show the importance of available primary and behavioral health care services they are able to provide in a rural population.</p>
    <p>NHCW is celebrated annually, during the second week of August, as part of the national observance of celebrating the success of America's health centers, and raising awareness about the mission and accomplishments of health centers as local solutions for affordable and accessible health care. Health centers serve more than 22 million people nationwide, and are increasingly becoming the trusted provider of choice for many families, whether they are insured or not.   Evidence shows patients choose health centers because they are convenient, affordable, and offer a range of services from a team of caring professionals. Studies also show the quality of care at a health center is as good, or even better than private practices.</p>
    <p>"Every day I witness the value our health centers have on our patients, by providing a patient-centered health care home for all," said T.J. Warren, Valley Professionals CEO. "When patients have a primary care provider they can trust, they are more likely to stay committed to their care, which in turn provides a healthier lifestyle. We provide a range of services on site, including primary care services, behavioral health services, and dental services. Our patients not only get the care they need under one roof, but they are treated as individuals, with dignity and respect. This is what health care should be, and what we celebrate during National Health Center Week."</p>
    <p>VPCHC is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) dedicated to providing comprehensive primary health care and related services for ALL individuals and families. VPCHC provides primary and preventive health care services, along with behavioral health services to the citizens of the Wabash Valley and surrounding communities.</p>

    <p>The Valley Professionals behavioral health team provided art therapy activities at the block party. They provided a blank canvas for children to cover with their own creations. Art therapy has proven beneficial to the development of self-awareness and positive self-esteem in children and young adults. As the young girl guides the brush along the canvas, she echoes the notion that VPCHC's mission is vital in shaping a positive and healthy future for generations to come.
